# Coding_Interview_Practice_Assessment

## Description

It’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. This is a simulation of a typical coding assessment. This assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

### User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
